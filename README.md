## Sorting Algorithms

Base code developed in undergraduate class (Data Structures II) aiming to compare the performance of sorting algorithms in Java, 
based on three input vectors of different sizes (chosen to be 100, 1000 and 10000 length) and also three different scenarios 
(ordered vector, reverse order vector and random vector). Now it generates a .csv file (similar as output.csv) with all scenarios and its data.

### Algorithms:
- BubbleSort
- InsertionSort
- SelectionSort
- MergeSort
- QuickSort
- ShellSort

### Scenarios:
- Vector lengths: 100, 1000, 10000
- Ordered vector, reverse order vector, random vector
